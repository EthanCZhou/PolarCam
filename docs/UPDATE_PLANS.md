1. Performance issue.
2. Try loop through each spot many times to capture speed change at long time
scale. (10s at spot 1, 10s at spot 2, then jump back to spot 1, etc...)
3. Choose sum intensity for speed time plot?
4. Plot fourkas angle (3d sphere) or y vs x vs sum to check electrical / light
noises. Elec noise at 50 Hz? Light at 100 Hz?
5. Check dependency in venv.
